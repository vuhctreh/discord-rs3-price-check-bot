### Gets the GE price of items via the Runescape wiki.

Small project done for fun; may or may not be updated in the future.

You will need to create a .env file with the following fields:

TOKEN =  
DATABASE =  

where TOKEN is the discord bot's token and DATABASE is the link to your mongo database.

By me and [Shyrogan](https://github.com/Shyrogan).
